#### ðŸŽ‰ Burst XBundle for macOS is coming soon!
I haven't had time to update this project with simple scripts for plotting/mining because I've been spending all my time working on a new bundled application which will allow you to install and run the Burst wallet along with plotting and mining all through a simple, clean user interface.
